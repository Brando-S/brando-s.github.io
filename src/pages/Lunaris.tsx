        <h1>Lunaris</h1>
        <p>
            Lunaris was an emulation project that aimed to emulate an older version of the popular MMORPG game Runescape. I worked on this project
            for 6 years and I loved every minute of it. When I started this project, I started it as a hobby project because I loved Runescape and
            I wanted to apply my own ideas to the game and create an enjoyable experience for others.
        </p>
        <h2>Achievements</h2>
        <p>
            When I started Lunaris it was just a hobby project. I had started and ran many small scale Runescape Private Servers before, but they never really
            gained much traction. I was determined to make something successful.
        </p>
        <p>
            I took the project from just me working on it with no users, to a functional business with 6 paid employees and a decently sized fanbase relative to the market.
            At one point, Lunaris was one of the largest Runescape Private Servers to exist, with a peak concurrent user count of 165 players.

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
            When I was young I was mostly an introvert and I found comfort in spending time on the internet.
            In all honesty, I was too shy to make a lot of friends in real life, so I instead made friends
            and joined communities on the internet. One community that I found myself in was Runescape.
            I started playing Runescape when I was very young, 8 years old to be exact.
        </p>
        <p>
            I really latched onto Runescape I think because of the social aspect of the game. There was a large map with a lot of people
            on the same game world all playing together at the same time. People would often stand around in groups in select cities to
            socialize and make friends. People even formed clans and played the game as a group. My older brother played, my cousins played,
            real-life friends played, etc. It was amazing.
        </p>
        <h4>Difficulty</h4>
        <p>
            Runescape is a very tedious and grindy game. Some players play on the same account for over 5,000 hours. As a young child,
            the game was too difficult for me to play efficiently. I just didn't have the attention span nor the skill to dedicate real time to a task
            to get better, therefore it was hard to make real progress towards meaningful goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            This led my friends and I to start playing private emulations of Runescape called <i>Runescape Private Servers</i> or <i>RSPS</i> for short.
            These emulations often had custom content and were generally an easier more sped up version of the game (though significantly lower quality). I loved these emulation projects
            because it allowed me to achieve the goals and the items that I was never able to in the real game.
        </p>
        <h4>Response</h4>
        <p>
            Having these very fun experiences and making these memories motivated me to create my own <i>Runescape Private Server</i>.
            I dreamed about my friends and others of playing a game that I made and experiencing them enjoy something that I created
            just like I experienced the games that I played.
        </p>
        <p> 
            When I was playing these <i>Runescape Private Servers</i> I was far too young to understand how to make my own. When I started to get older (~12 Years Old)
            I started to attempt to make one as best I could. I had no idea what I was doing, but I just tinkered around with open sourced projects until
            I could get something running. I have very fond memories of me opening Java source code files with the native windows text editor Notepad, trying to "code" any changes
            I could, saving these files, and running a batch script to compile them into Java Byte Code to run. I remember that if I had a syntax error, I really didn't even know
            because I wasn't using an IDE. I would try to compile and see a list of errors that I didn't understand, so I would panick and just undo my changes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eventually as I grew older and tinkered around more and more, I started to actually learn and make meaningful progress. I eventually learned what an IDE was and started
            actually learning how to code. The rest is history.
